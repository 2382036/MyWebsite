            <p>Hello, I am <b>Renaldi AF Tefa</b>.
                I will tell you about my holiday over several months. 
                My friends and I planned a trip to <i>Jakarta</i> to take part in a futsal tournament. 
                After finishing school work, my friends and I finally left for Jakarta. 
                When we arrived in the city of <i>Jakarta</i>, the sun was still low in the sky. 
                The very fresh air and relaxed atmosphere made us even more enthusiastic. We went straight to the futsal field and started practicing with full intensity.</p>
     
         <h3>Activities I Enjoyed</h3>
             <p>After warming up for a few minutes, my friends and I immediately played the first match with enthusiasm. 
                We ran around playing ball and used smart strategies. 
                We also enjoyed the snacks we brought and rested under the umbrella. 
                While enjoying the food, we discussed strategies to face the following teams. 
                We played with enthusiasm and strong teamwork, making every match very interesting even though we had to be satisfied with a defeat in the top 8, which meant we were eliminated early and failed to win.</p>
     
             <p>After the match was over, we had an extraordinary playing experience. 
                We sat on the field bench, enjoyed the beauty of the afternoon, and talked about our hopes for the future. 
                This holiday became a very beautiful memory for me and my friends, and we returned to Bandung to our respective lodgings with happy hearts and unforgettable memories.</p>
